<p>You may have two 3rd party libraries that use some same classes. Which should make this kind of error while building: <p>
**ld: duplicate symbols xxxx....**

What alternatives do i have ?

######One way I want to recommend :
 Keep only one copy of classes in only one 3rd party library and remove duplicated classes from other 3rd parties.
 
<p> Here are two C command-line application.<p>
######1.  One is used to extract all .o files (class file) in relative folder for different platform。
 
###### Run like this：
** ./Extract_O_files_4_different_platform.run /Users/kevin/Desktop/tempfolder/lib_The_library_you_want_to_extract_.a**

Then you will get this extracted .a for different platform and relative Dir contains  classes.o

**Delete the classes.o which are duplicated**

######2. Another is used to archive classes.o to xxx.a and combine different platform xxx.a to a fat xxx-final_combined.a (The new 3rd party static library without duplicated classes)
 
###### Run like this：
** ./compress_and_combine_O_folder_2_lib.c.run liba.a-arm64Dir liba.a-armv7Dir /liba.a-armv7sDir liba.a-i386Dir liba.a-x86_64Dir**

Then you will get the combined fat xxx-final_combined.a for all platforms but without duplicated  classes

**Replace the old 3rd party static library with the new one**
